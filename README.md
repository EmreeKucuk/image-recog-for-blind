# Object Recognition for Visually Impaired

This project is a Python-based application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by recognizing objects in images and providing audio feedback. The application uses a YOLO model for object detection and integrates text-to-speech and speech recognition functionalities for interaction.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects objects in an image using a pre-trained YOLO model.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides audio feedback for detected objects.
- **Speech Recognition**: Allows users to ask about specific objects in the image using voice commands.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A simple Tkinter-based interface for interaction.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the application:

- `ultralytics`
- `pyttsx3`
- `SpeechRecognition`
- `pyaudio`
- `opencv-python`
- `Pillow`
- `tkinter`

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r [requirements.txt](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
```
